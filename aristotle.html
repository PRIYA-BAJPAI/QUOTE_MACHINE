        <li>Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.</li>
        <li>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.</li>
        <li>Happiness depends upon ourselves.</li>
        <li>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.</li>
        <li>The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</li>
    </ul>
