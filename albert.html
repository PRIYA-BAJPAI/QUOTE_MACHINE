    <ul>
        <li>Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution</li>
        <li>Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving</li>
        <li>The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing</li>
        <li>Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.</li>
        <li>In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.</li>
    </ul>
