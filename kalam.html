    <h1>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</h1>
    <img src="./kalam.png" alt="">
    <ul>
        <li>Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts, and thoughts result in action</li>
        <li>You have to dream before your dreams can come true.</li>
        <li>Excellence happens not by accident. It is a process</li>
        <li>Donâ€™t take rest after your first victory because if you fail in second, more lips are waiting to say that your first victory was just luck.</li>
        <li>All of us do not have equal talent. But, all of us have an equal opportunity to develop our talents.</li>
