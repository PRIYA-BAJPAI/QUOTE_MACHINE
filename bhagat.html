    <ul>
        <li>They may kill me, but they cannot kill my ideas. They can crush my body, but they will not be able to crush my spirit.</li>
        <li>Revolution is an inalienable right of mankind. Freedom is an imperishable birthright of all.</li>
        <li>Merciless criticism and independent thinking are the two necessary traits of revolutionary thinking.</li>
        <li>Bombs and pistols do not make a revolution. The sword of revolution is sharpened on the whetting-stone of ideas.</li>
        <li>I am full of ambition to see our country free and I am ready to sacrifice my life for it</li>
    </ul>
