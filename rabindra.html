        <li>You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water</li>
        <li>Everything comes to us that belongs to us if we create the capacity to receive it</li>
        <li>I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy.
